## Description
**Controller Aim Trainer** is a simple, customizable aiming practice game built using Python and Pygame. It allows users to configure their game controller, choosing which joystick stick to use for aiming and which button/trigger to use for shooting. The game tracks your score and calculates the average time between successful hits, helping you improve your reflexes and precision.

## Features

- **Simple and Fun**: A lightweight game to practice your aiming skills.

## Requirements
To run the project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- A game controller (with at least 1 stick and 1 button)

### Installing Dependencies

To install Pygame, use pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Use
1. **Connect your Game Controller**: Plug in your game controller to your computer.
2. **Run the Program**: Execute the `Controller Aim Trainer.py` script to start the game.
3. **Choose Aiming Stick**: The program will ask you to select which stick you want to use for aiming. Move the desired joystick to confirm.
4. **Choose Shooting Button**: The program will then ask you to select which button or trigger you want to use to shoot. Press the desired button/trigger.
5. **Start Training**: The game will display a target on the screen. Aim with the selected stick and shoot with the chosen button. The score and average reaction time will be shown.
6. **Quit**: Close the window or press the escape key to quit the game.

## Controls
- **Aiming**: Move the selected joystick stick to aim at the target.
- **Shooting**: Press the selected button or trigger to shoot at the target.
- **Quit**: Close the window or press the escape key.


## Troubleshooting
- **Controller not detected**: Make sure your controller is connected correctly. If it’s not showing up, try using software like **DS4Windows** (for PS-style controllers) or **Xpadder** to remap your buttons.
- **Extra buttons (M1, M2, M3, M4) not working**: These buttons might not be mapped by default. Check your controller’s configuration software to ensure they are mapped properly.
